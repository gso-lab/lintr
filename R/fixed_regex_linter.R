#' Require usage of `fixed=TRUE` in regular expressions where appropriate

#' Invoking a regular expression engine is overkill for cases when the search
#'   pattern only involves static patterns.
#'
#' NB: for `stringr` functions, that means wrapping the pattern in `stringr::fixed()`.
#'
#' NB: This linter is likely not able to distinguish every possible case when
#'   a fixed regular expression is preferable, rather it seeks to identify
#'   likely cases. It should _never_ report false positives, however; please
